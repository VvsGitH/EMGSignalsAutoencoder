# SYNERGY BASED EMG AND FORCE ESTIMATION WITH NEURAL NETWORKS
Student's project from Politecnico di Bari  
Authors: Coscia Claudia, Paparella Santorsola VIto  
Based on NINAPRO database 2

This project aims to obtain a good estimation of finger forces starting from emg signals.  
It tests four different estimation methods, three of them being synergy based:  
  1. Linear force recostrcution from EMG.  
  2. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization of EMG signals and force estimation with Hc model.  
  3. Autoencoder EMG recostruction and force estimation with Hae model.  
  4. Parallel EMG and force recostruction with a custom double output shallow neural network.  
    
The results shows that the NNMF is the best method to reconstruct the EMG signals, while the 
4th method is the best for the force reconstruction.
